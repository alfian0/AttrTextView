# AttrTextView
A custom UI text view that allows # and @ symbols to be separated from the rest of the text
and triggers actions upon selection.

TO DO:
Currently using a constant value to perform granularity. This means that while the TextView works great for most common font sizes ie. 6-16 or so, it will not be perfectly accurate for others. I plan on creating a custom algorithm to get the pixel width of specific font sizes.
